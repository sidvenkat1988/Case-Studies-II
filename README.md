# Case-Studies-II
This is done as a part of my university module in which I aim to recognize faces and voices using Autoencoders. The datasets chosen were:
1) Labelled Faces in the Wild for face classification and
2) LibriSpeech ASR corpus for voice classification.

The models folder contains the notebooks in which the face and the voice models were trained.

The Face Data Preprocessing and the Voice Data Preprocessing folders contain the notebooks in which all the preprocessing steps were followed.

All the raw data, transformed data and the steps followed in the implementation of this project can be found in this link:
